Feature: The Update subscriptions

  Background:
    Given I presetup an "UC" SYA case
    And I am signed in as a Case Officer
    When I navigate to an existing case
    Then the case should be in "With DWP" state

    When I switch to be a DWPResponse Writer
    And I choose "Update subscription"

  Scenario: Update Subscription - Yes
    And I subscribed to all parties to "Yes"

  Scenario: Update Subscription - No
    And I subscribed to all parties to "No"
